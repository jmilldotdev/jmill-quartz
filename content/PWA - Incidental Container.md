PWA is pleased to announce the opening of Incidental Container, an exhibition exploring artworks as physical and digital storage.

The works exhibited at PWA were originally installed in a CubeSmart self-storage unit for the duration of a “First Month Free'' promotional contract. There was no public access to the original exhibition. Participating artists were asked to transfer works into the storage-unit from their own physical or digital storage. All equipment used to power and display artists’ works utilized 15-Day return policies. 

The works now exhibited at PWA are scanned and filmed documentation of the original installation, which is streaming on gallery monitors from a “Free 30-Day” Dropbox account. 

 In addition to the documentation exhibited at PWA, an interactive browser-based video is on display archiving the original installation. Also presented in the gallery are images and video of the container's interior seen with a volume of hanging translucent fabric. A quarter through the free month contract, the installation was scanned and captured with 360º video. It was then developed into a browser-based interactive tour. The HTML code responsible for the virtual tour's structure and content was then sublimated into translucent fabric. After the artists' works were de-installed the coded fabrics were installed in the container. The fabrics remained hanging in the unit until it was vacated prior to payment.
 
At PWA the fabrics have now been sewn into purchasable tote-bags.

_Incidental Container_ is simultaneously a singular artwork and group show conceived and organized by Jason Isolini.

Featuring artists: Jake Brush, Courtlin Byrd, Tomi Faison, Sarah Friend, Xavier McFarlin, Rebecca Millsop, Zach Nader, Georgica Pettus, and Molly Soda.
