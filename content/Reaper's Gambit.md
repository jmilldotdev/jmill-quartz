The REAPER‚ÄôS GAMBIT is an on-chain conceptual artwork. There 999,999,999 $RG ERC20 tokens, no more can be minted, and all have been placed in a Uniswap V2 pool. The LP tokens have been burned. The smart contract was entirely generated with ChatGPT.

Once an address receives some token, they become non-transferable after 64800 blocks (9 days). Collectors must send their tokens to a fresh wallet before that period, or they will remain in limbo forever. No address can be used twice. The goal is to escape the Reaper for as long as possible in this marathon of death.

Use the "balanceOf" read function to know exactly how many tokens to transfer if you transfer directly with the smart contract. You can check when your wallet will be locked using the "KnowDeath" read function and then use this Etherscan tool to know how many days remain before you need to move your tokens.

This token is an on-chain artwork by Figure31. Please make sure you understand how the token behaves before collecting it. You shouldn't have any expectations. This token is an artistic experiment and should be treated as such. The smart contract is verified, but it is not audited. DYOR.
