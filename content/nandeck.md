**nanDECK** is a software for Windows (any version) written as an aid for game inventors, with the aim of speeding up the process of designing and printing deck of cards (useful during prototyping and playtesting).

nanDECK is free, you can download it and use freely, without limitations (but a donation, of course, is really welcome).
