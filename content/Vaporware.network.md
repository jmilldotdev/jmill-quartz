Vaporware is a program that runs on a new kind of internet computer, called a ship. Ships are built on a novel virtual machine, called a solid-state interpreter.

Ships combine the functionality of wallets, large file storage, encrypted p2p networking, and full stack web applications into a single framework. They are designed to run in the cloud, but are owned cryptographically by people. Ships are internet appliances.
