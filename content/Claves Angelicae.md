_Claves Angelic√¶_ is a procedural system to inscribe a magical Word onto the Ethereum network where it exalted as a sigil in the form of a non-fungible token.

Magic is the esoteric method of causing change to occur in conformity with one‚Äôs Will. Magic has many properties, but a primary aspect is coordinating one one‚Äôs internal Will with one‚Äôs external Words.

A magical spell is quite literally the spelling of a Word.
