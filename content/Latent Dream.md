In _Latent Dream_ you explore a dream fragment summoned from the infinite depths of Wikipedia. Each dream run is unique and based on a fragment of our collective knowledge.  
  
In a dream, you take on the role of a thing, or a person, or an animal. Go explore.  
  
_Latent Dream_ is built on gpt-4 and [glif.app](https://glif.app/), a powerful and fun new AI prompt chaining sandbox.
