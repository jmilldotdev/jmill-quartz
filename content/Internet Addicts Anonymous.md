Welcome! Our online meeting schedule can be found below. In recovery, we seek to identify and abstain from compulsive internet use while also learning to use technology in a healthy, functional way. This can include attending online meetings or dialing into meetings by phone, in addition to attending in-person meetings in our area.

Meeting times are displayed in your local time zone. You can find the details for each meeting, including the video link and dial-in numbers by clicking on the meeting event in the calendar. Please note that you need a Zoom account to join. You can view our full weekly schedule by clicking ‚ÄúDay‚Äù on the top right and switching it to ‚ÄúWeek‚Äù. Below the calendar is a full explanation of the color code. In addition to English, we also have meetings in French, Spanish, Russian, German, Dutch, Hebrew, Arabic, Polish, and Portuguese.

If you are new, we encourage to you try attending six meetings in a short time frame to see whether our program may be helpful to you. Each meeting is slightly different, and we are always happy to welcome newcomers. All meetings are completely free and anonymous. Please reach out if you have any trouble joining a meeting.

We also have a separate calendar that displays meetings in which an ITAA member opens the meeting by sharing their experience, strength, and hope.
