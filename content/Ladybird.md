Welcome toÂ Ladybird,
a truly independent  
web browser.

We are building a brand-new browser from scratch, backed by a non-profit.

Ladybird is a brand-new browser & web engine. Driven by a web standards first approach, Ladybird aims to render the modern web with good performance, stability and security.

From its humble beginnings as an HTML viewer for the SerenityOS hobby operating system project, Ladybird has since grown into a cross-platform browser supporting Linux, macOS, and other Unix-like systems.

Ladybird is currently in heavy development. We are targeting a first Alpha release for early adopters in 2026.
