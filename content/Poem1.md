Hey so I made a clock. It tells the time with a brand new poem every minute, composed by ChatGPT. It’s sometimes profound, and sometimes weird, and very occasionally it fibs about what the actual time is to make a rhyme work 😬 It has a cute e-paper screen.

I’ve had the prototype on my shelf for a few months.

Now it’s time to get it into your hands.

It’s called Poem/1.
