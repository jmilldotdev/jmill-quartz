## [GPT4All: An ecosystem of open-source on-edge large language models.](https://github.com/nomic-ai/gpt4all#gpt4all-an-ecosystem-of-open-source-on-edge-large-language-models)

GPT4All is an ecosystem to train and deploy **powerful** and **customized** large language models that run locally on consumer grade CPUs. Note that your CPU needs to support [AVX or AVX2 instructions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Vector_Extensions).

Learn more in the [documentation](https://docs.gpt4all.io/).

The goal is simple - be the best instruction tuned assistant-style language model that any person or enterprise can freely use, distribute and build on.

A GPT4All model is a 3GB - 8GB file that you can download and plug into the GPT4All open-source ecosystem software. **Nomic AI** supports and maintains this software ecosystem to enforce quality and security alongside spearheading the effort to allow any person or enterprise to easily train and deploy their own on-edge large language models.
