Mercury Prime is a winner generated roguelike. Each day, players compete to earn the right to expand the game - inventing new creatures, items, and powers to add to their worlds. Each week, worlds compete to become Mercury Prime -- the morphing, twisting, liquid metal center at the heart of Mercury.
