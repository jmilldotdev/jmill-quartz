HTML is behind every website we view. Every day, HTML is all around us. Come write some in the park together!

We'll be hanging out for a few hours with picnic blankets, snacks, and sparkly water available. You'll just need to show up with your own computer or HTML-writing device.

If you'd like, any websites can be published on an archival webring afterwards!
