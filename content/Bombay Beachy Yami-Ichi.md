An [The Internet Yami-Ichi](http://yami-ichi.biz/) held in Bombay Beach, California during the [Bombay Beach Biennale](https://www.bombaybeachbiennale.org/).

BCAD & several other artists made many small projects for sale at this pop-up market. All projects are listed on the [website](https://www.bbyi.fyi/).

Some favorites I worked on:
