**Tabloid** is a turing-complete programming language for writing programs in the style of clickbait news headlines.

Here are a few things **the Top Five Most Popular Quirks and Features** of the Tabloid programming language **(Number Four Will Shock You!)**

-   Print output with the keywords `YOU WON'T WANT TO MISS` followed by an expression. Everything printed by Tabloid is **automatically capitalized, and an exclamation point is added.** Why would you want anything else?
-   Declare a function by writing `DISCOVER HOW TO ... WITH`. Truly, a more gripping way to declare a function can't possibly exist! Similarly, assign to a variable with `EXPERTS CLAIM ... TO BE`. On the Internet, anyone can be an expert, and Tabloid gives YOU the power to wield that responsibility and declare anything you'd like!
-   There are **no built-in constructs for looping**. The news cycle is moving too fast! Nobody has time for yesterday's loops or last week's break statements. If you must loop, use recursion.
-   To return from a function, simply write `SHOCKING DEVELOPMENT`! You're going to—gasp!—**return**? How shocking!
-   Every program must end with `PLEASE LIKE AND SUBSCRIBE`, because you have to grow your audience! **Hashtag hustle**.
