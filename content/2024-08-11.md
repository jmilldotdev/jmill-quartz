## Notes

okay for real though you need to do something. you need to sit back and reflect. the dopamine receptors in your brain are broken and you're stuck on tutti work. you can't just share. it would be as simple as setting `publish: true`

the universal card game adapter would be kinda cool but you need to clear out the tutti work first.

the biggest missing things at this point are:
- [ ] modal emitting results to db
- [ ] textract writing results to db
- [ ] app calling modal fn
- [ ] deploying modal fn
