In Autumn 2022, Other Internet and Leave Room for Thoughts, two young learning institutes, came together to cultivate a new fellowship program named Campus Complex. It was a month-long educational experiment that unfolded across the City of New York.

The program turned a disconnected group of private offices and studios into a traversable network of learning environments for three builders, artists, and researchers. Each fellow received a passport, called a Learner Card, to our constellation of spaces and educators. Their mission was to use the tools and affordances of the Campus to further their educational endeavors.
