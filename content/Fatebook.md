Self-assigned prediction markets

Why build a habit of forecasting?
Make better decisions
Get a clearer view of the consequences by thinking about the important questions.
Communicate more clearly
Write down your prediction as a probability. 'Probably' is ambiguous, '80%' isn't.
Build your track record
Resolve your predictions as YES, NO or AMBIGUOUS. A feedback loop to develop powerful habits of mind.
