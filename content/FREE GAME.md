Virgil Abloh‚Ñ¢ has launched a resource center for brands in their earliest phases. The resource center includes a table of contents from A-Z, covering topics such as how to name your brand, how to obtain a trademark, how to use Adobe Creative Suite, how to make a screen print, how to find blanks, how to shoot a lookbook, how to make a website, how to add Shopify, overarching lectures, figures of speech catalogue, personal mentors, and further inspiration. The goal of this resource is to uplift more than a few and provide access to information and mentorship for young black designers and those coming from non-traditional backgrounds.
