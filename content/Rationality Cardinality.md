Rationality Cardinality is a party game for sneakily exposing yourself and your friends to useful concepts, in the most amusing possible way. The rules are similar to those of Apples to Apples or Cards Against Humanity: In each round, one player reads a Question card, and each other player selects an Answer card to match it. Unlike those games, however, the cards are designed to simultaneously make you laugh, and teach you something.

If you really want to learn about heuristics and biases, logical fallacies, and how to reason well, and you want to learn as quickly as possible, then you should go read books. Or blog posts. Definitely don't spend that time hanging out with your friends enjoying life. But if you're going to be enjoying life anyways, you can simultaneously learn things, and enjoy harder, if you have a deck of Rationality Cardinality around.
