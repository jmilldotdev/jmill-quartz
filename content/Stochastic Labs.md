Stochastic Labs convenes leading creative minds in the SF bay area and beyond for conversations about the future of technology, science, entrepreneurship, and the arts (in a curious Victorian mansion in Berkeley). Events are by invitation but you can apply for seed funds for your creative tech venture (we take no equity) or to be an artist/engineer in residence (yes, there’s a laser-cutter and a tower).
