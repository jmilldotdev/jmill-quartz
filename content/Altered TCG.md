FOR FANS OF TRADING CARD GAMES, ALTERED IS A DREAM COME TRUE.

EXPLORE THE UNEXPECTED
Aspiring to address the pitfalls that the trading card game market has faced over the last 30 years, we have crafted this ambitious project to rekindle the magic within the genre. What defines us? A core of optimism, kindness, sharing, and a profound longing for modernity. Crafted by a team of thirty enthusiasts based in Paris and led by the visionary R√©gis Bonness√©e (known for Dixit, Mysterium, Diceforge, and Seasons), we are thrilled to finally unveil the culmination of the positive energy that has fueled our efforts for the past three years. Welcome to the adventure!
