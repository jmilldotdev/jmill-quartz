Misalignment Museum is an art installation in San Francisco that imagines a post-apocalyptic world where Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) has destroyed most of humanity and created the museum as a memorial and apology to the remaining humans. The museum aims to increase knowledge about AGI and its power for destruction and good, and to create a space for reflection and critical thinking about Artificial Intelligence and its implications. The goal is to inspire and build support to formulate and enact risk mitigation measures to ensure a positive future as AI continues to develop, and in the advent of AGI.
