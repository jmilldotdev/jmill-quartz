JPG is a platform that features Juried Protocol Galleries, which are collections of NFTs (non-fungible tokens) that adhere to specific canons. These canons include Derivatives, which are NFTs that are primarily derived from other NFTs, Crypto-Social-Aesthetics, which exhibit crypto-social characteristics beyond that which is inherent to a networked asset, Conceptual, which prioritize the idea or concept over traditional aesthetic, technical, or material concerns, and Dynamic, which create a continuously evolving experience through programmatic or interactive means.
