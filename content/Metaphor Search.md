## What is Metaphor?

Metaphor is a search engine designed from scratch using AI. Our goal is to find what your smartest friend could find you in a week, but instantaneously. By discovering new ways to search the internet, we'll rediscover the internet.

Imagine being able to search the entire repository of humanity's knowledge (the internet) with queries of any complexity (think multiple sentences!) and find exactly the results that match your query. AI has gotten so good that this is now possible. Metaphor's current model is a step in that direction.

## How to use Metaphor

Metaphor's AI model is trained to do link prediction. This means that given some text prompt, it tries to predict the link that would most likely follow that prompt. Because of the way our current model was trained, the best prompts resemble how someone on the internet might refer to a link. (We're working on fixing this model quirk, but for now these guidelines will help make your search experience way better!)
